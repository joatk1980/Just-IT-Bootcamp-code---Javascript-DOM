JavaScript DOM Challenge Task

Step 1: Set Up Your Files

Create New Files:

Create a new HTML file (e.g., index.html).

Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., script.js).

Ensure both files are linked correctly.


You can do this by adding the following line within the

<head> or just before the closing </body> tag of your 

HTML file: 

<script src="script.js"></script>

In your script.js file, use a DOM query method (e.g., document.querySelector) to select the <h1> element.

Store the selected element in a variable.




Step 3: Add an ID, Update Text Content, and Style the <h1>

Add an ID to the <h1> Element:

Add the <ul> to the Document:

Append the <ul> element to the <body> or another appropriate element in your HTML document.

Step 5: Edit the <li> Elementsâ€™ Content and Style




Loop Through the <li> Elements:

Use a loop to iterate over each <li> element you created.
