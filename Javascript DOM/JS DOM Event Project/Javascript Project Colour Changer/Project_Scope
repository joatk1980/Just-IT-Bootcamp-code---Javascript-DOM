JavaScript Project : Simple Colour Changer

Introduction

Create a JavaScript program that changes the background colour of a web page when the user clicks a button. This project helps learners understand basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Project Requirements
Welcome Message: Display a welcome message to the user.
Colour Button: Provide a button that, when clicked, changes the background colour of the web page.
Multiple Colours: Cycle through at least three different background colours.
Current Colour: Display the name of the current background colour on the page.
Styling: Apply basic styling to the button to make it visually appealing.
Design Considerations
Structure your program with clear and organized functions.
Use JavaScript's DOM manipulation to change the background colour and update the displayed colour name.
Ensure your code is modular and readable.
