JavaScript Events Tasks

Before starting, familiarise yourself with the Event object documentation to understand

what information you can access through events and how this information might be used in your tasks.

Task 1: Click Event - Show and Hide Menus

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Create the HTML Structure:

Add two buttons: one labeled "See Food Menu" and another labeled "See Drink Menu."

Create corresponding content areas for the food and drink menus.

Add Event Listeners in JavaScript:

Write a function that toggles the visibility of the menu when the button is clicked.

Use a method to change the button text based on whether the menu is visible or hidden.

Test and Debug:

Ensure the menus show and hide as expected when the buttons are clicked, and that the button text updates correctly.

Task 2: Mouse Over and Mouse Out Events - Highlight Text

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Create the HTML Structure:

Add a paragraph or heading element that will react when the mouse hovers over it.

Add Event Listeners in JavaScript:

Write functions to change the text and background color when the mouse is over the element and when it moves out.

Test and Debug:

Test that the text and background color change appropriately when you move your mouse over and out of the element.

Task 3: Keypress Event - Change Input Field Style

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Create the HTML Structure:

Set up a simple form with text input fields.

Add Event Listener in JavaScript:

Create a function that changes the background and text color of the input field whenever a key is pressed.

Test and Debug:

Type into the input field and verify that the style changes as expected.

Research Tasks

Task 1: Add an Element to the DOM

Create the HTML Structure:

Add a text input field and a submit button to your page.

Add Event Listener in JavaScript:

Write a function to create and add a new element to the DOM containing the input field's value when the button is clicked.

Optionally, clear the input field after submission.

Test and Debug:

Make sure a new element is added with the correct content, and that the input field clears as intended.

Task 2: Create a Counter

Create the HTML Structure:

Add buttons for incrementing and decrementing a counter, along with a display area to show the current count.

Add Event Listeners in JavaScript:

Write functions to increase or decrease the counter value each time the respective button is clicked.

Test and Debug:

Verify that the counter updates correctly when the buttons are pressed.

Task 3: Show/Hide an Image

Create the HTML Structure:

Include an image and a button that will toggle its visibility.

Add Event Listener in JavaScript:

Write a function to show or hide the image when the button is clicked, and update the button text to reflect the current state.

Test and Debug:

Check that the image visibility toggles correctly and that the button text changes accordingly with each click.

By following these instructions, you'll gain hands-on experience with JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation, which are fundamental concepts in web development.
